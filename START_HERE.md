## ⚠️ Important Tips

### Before Interview:
1. 🚨 **Visit your deployed site 2 minutes before interview**
   - Reason: Render free tier sleeps, takes 50 seconds to wake up
   - First load will be slow, but after that it's fast

2. 📝 **Test login credentials:**
   - Host: `host_user` / `password123`
   - Traveler: `traveler_user` / `password123`

3. 🌟 **Test all features once:**
   - Browse listings
   - View listing details
   - Login/Logout
   - Create listing (as host)
   - Add review

### During Interview:
- ✅ "First load takes a moment as the server wakes up (free tier)"
- ✅ "Implemented cold start mitigation with UptimeRobot"
- ✅ "Can upgrade to paid tier for production deployment"
