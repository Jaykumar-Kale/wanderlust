# 🌍 Wanderlust – Airbnb Clone

Wanderlust is a **full-stack web application** inspired by [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com).  
It allows users to explore stays, book rentals, and manage their own listings — all in one platform.  
This project is built as part of my **full-stack development journey** and portfolio showcase.
